# Conway Recorder

A java port of John Conway's Game of Life that outputs all generations of the grid to .png files. Requires LWJGL 2 to run.

# How to use
Given Conway's Game of Life is a Zero-Player game, the program requires no input from the user once it starts. The images rendered from the program will be dropped into a folder named after the grid dimensions (Default is 240x144)

Dimensions can be altered in the Conway.java file, however be advised that larger grid sizes will cause the program to slow down relative to the amount of data being written.

# Okay, but why?
Because I can.
